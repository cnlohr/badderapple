# Very compressed song-maker


## Using BadApple-mod.mid

`BadApple-mod.mid` has unknown origin. It was uploaded On 2015-03-01 by livingston26 and uploaded [here](https://musescore.com/user/1467236/scores/678091), but credit was given to cherry_berry17.  I was unable to find them.  Then it was transcribed to MIDI.

I modified it so that it would be the full 3:40 min runtime.
